# About
This directory contains scans of the "Coleopterorum Catalogus" which where manually curated by Lutz Behne (25.4.1956 â€“ 25.8.2024). When he scanned Literature, he took great care that every character in scientific names is correctly recognized, and if necessary he corrected them. Thus, he ensured that his files are reliably searchable for scientific names.

The following is a translation of the original "readme" by Lutz Behne, a file which is named "Junk_Curculionoidea_Datierung_Kataloge.pdf" and was last modified 2006/03/27.
